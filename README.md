At my desk sits a skull  
![Alt text](skully.jpg?raw=true "Title")  
To pass the time, sometimes we play chess.  
When I am away, we email our moves to eachother. We take 30mins or so between moves, so as not to bother eachother.
Of course, skully could beat me every time, but out of kindness, they modulate the difficulty to be intersting, but not impossible
  \- and to fit the skill of the player.
  
  
If you would like your own chess bot, simply use the script. One can play locally over terminal, or use as a daemon to play over email.

(The code is designed for linux -Ubuntu 18-, uses python wih virtual-env, and the stockfish chess engine.
However, it is designed to be relativly agnostic to the OS, so long as you can source a stockfish engine for your architecture.)  
  
  Thanks!
